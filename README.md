# catalyst-hangperson-game

Run script/hangpersongame_server.pl to test the application.

Or use "carton install" to install requisites from the `cpanfile`
included in the application. A `cpanfile.snapshot` will be created.

Once all the requirements are installed in ./local the application
can be run with:

    `carton exec plackup app.psgi` 

`plackup` will automatically look for `app.psgi` so it is optional.
In this version of the application, `app.psgi` is a copy of the 
`hangpersongame.psgi` generated by the `catalyst.pl` helper script.
