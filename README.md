# catalyst-hangperson-game

Install using:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
    make test

Run `script/hangpersongame_server.pl` to test the application locally.

Or, use `carton install` to install prerequisites from the `cpanfile`
included in the application.  A `cpanfile.snapshot` will be created
that will ensure the prequisites for the application are versions
known to work with the existing code.

Once all the requirements are installed in `./local` the application
can be run with:

    carton exec plackup app.psgi 

`plackup` will automatically look for `app.psgi` so it is and
optional argument.  In this version of the application, `app.psgi`
is a copy of the `hangpersongame.psgi` generated by the `catalyst.pl`
helper script.

The application should be deployable to Heroku:

    git clone https://github.com/opendevnet/catalyst-hangperson-game
    cd catalyst-hangperson-game
    heroku apps:create     # an <APP NAME> will be created
    heroku git:remote --app <APP NAME>
    heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/miyagawa/heroku-buildpack-perl
    git push heroku master
